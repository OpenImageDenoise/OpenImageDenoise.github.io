<h1 id="intel-open-image-denoise-overview">Intel Open Image Denoise Overview</h1>
<p>Intel Open Image Denoise is an open source library of high-performance, high-quality denoising filters for images rendered with ray tracing. Intel Open Image Denoise is part of the <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/rendering-framework">Intel® oneAPI Rendering Toolkit</a> and is released under the permissive <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 license</a>.</p>
<p>The purpose of Intel Open Image Denoise is to provide an open, high-quality, efficient, and easy-to-use denoising library that allows one to significantly reduce rendering times in ray tracing based rendering applications. It filters out the Monte Carlo noise inherent to stochastic ray tracing methods like path tracing, reducing the amount of necessary samples per pixel by even multiple orders of magnitude (depending on the desired closeness to the ground truth). A simple but flexible C/C++ API ensures that the library can be easily integrated into most existing or new rendering solutions.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Intel Open Image Denoise library is an efficient deep learning based denoising filter, which was trained to handle a wide range of samples per pixel (spp), from 1 spp to almost fully converged. Thus it is suitable for both preview and final-frame rendering. The filters can denoise images either using only the noisy color (<em>beauty</em>) buffer, or, to preserve as much detail as possible, can optionally utilize auxiliary feature buffers as well (e.g. albedo, normal). Such buffers are supported by most renderers as arbitrary output variables (AOVs) or can be usually implemented with little effort.</p>
<p>Intel Open Image Denoise supports Intel® 64 architecture based CPUs and compatible architectures, and runs on anything from laptops, to workstations, to compute nodes in HPC systems. It is efficient enough to be suitable not only for offline rendering, but, depending on the hardware used, also for interactive ray tracing.</p>
<p>Intel Open Image Denoise internally builds on top of <a href="https://github.com/intel/mkl-dnn">Intel® Math Kernel Library for Deep Neural Networks (MKL-DNN)</a>, and automatically exploits modern instruction sets like Intel SSE4, AVX2, and AVX-512 to achieve high denoising performance. A CPU with support for at least SSE4.1 is required to run Intel Open Image Denoise.</p>

<h2 id="version-history">Version History</h2>
<h3 id="changes-in-v1.1.0">Changes in v1.1.0:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added <code>RTLightmap</code> filter optimized for lightmaps</li>
<li>Added <code>hdrScale</code> filter parameter for manually specifying the mapping of HDR color values to luminance levels</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changes-in-v1.0.0">Changes in v1.0.0:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved denoising quality
<ul>
<li>More details preserved</li>
<li>Less artifacts (e.g. noisy spots, color bleeding with albedo/normal)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Added <code>maxMemoryMB</code> filter parameter for limiting the maximum memory consumption regardless of the image resolution, potentially at the cost of lower denoising speed. This is internally implemented by denoising the image in tiles</li>
<li>Significantly reduced memory consumption (but slightly lower performance) for high resolutions (&gt; 2K) by default: limited to about 6 GB</li>
<li>Added <code>alignment</code> and <code>overlap</code> filter parameters that can be queried for manual tiled denoising</li>
<li>Added <code>verbose</code> device parameter for setting the verbosity of the console output, and disabled all console output by default</li>
<li>Fixed crash for zero-sized images</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changes-in-v0.9.0">Changes in v0.9.0:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reduced memory consumption by about 38%</li>
<li>Added support for progress monitor callback functions</li>
<li>Enabled fully concurrent execution when using multiple devices</li>
<li>Clamp LDR input and output colors to 1</li>
<li>Fixed issue where some memory allocation errors were not reported</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changes-in-v0.8.2">Changes in v0.8.2:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed wrong HDR output when the input contains infinities/NaNs</li>
<li>Fixed wrong output when multiple filters were executed concurrently on separate devices with AVX-512 support. Currently the filter executions are serialized as a temporary workaround, and a full fix will be included in a future release.</li>
<li>Added OIDN_STATIC_LIB CMake option for building as a static library (requires CMake 3.13.0 or later)</li>
<li>Fixed CMake error when adding the library with add_subdirectory() to a project</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changes-in-v0.8.1">Changes in v0.8.1:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed wrong path to TBB in the generated CMake configs</li>
<li>Fixed wrong rpath in the binaries</li>
<li>Fixed compile error on some macOS systems</li>
<li>Fixed minor compile issues with Visual Studio</li>
<li>Lowered the CPU requirement to SSE4.1</li>
<li>Minor example update</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changes-in-v0.8.0">Changes in v0.8.0:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Initial beta release</li>
</ul>
